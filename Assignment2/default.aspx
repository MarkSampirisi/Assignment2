    <h1>Welcome to Mark's Hotel Management System</h1>
    <div class="well">
        <p>Hello! My name is Mark Sampirisi, amateur programmer and Georgian College student.</p>
        <p> This is a web application built for COMP2007 Enterprise Computing. 
            It functions as a basic room booking system for use by the owners/administrators,
            allowing them check customers into rooms, view room details, and view customer booking 
            details. Rooms can be added, edited, or deleted. Customers can be checked out out of
            rooms, allowing the room to be used for another customer. Admin pages require a login
            to access. 
        </p>
